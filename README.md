The Last Dance
==============

The Last Dance is an site-specific installation, paying homage to the last ITP Camp at the 4th floor of 721 Broadway, affectionately known by many as "The Floor".

In playfully humanzing The Floor, the three room installation seeks to create last intimate moments with the floor.

The Last Dance: a private dancefloor, for you and The Floor to enjoy your last dance together.
Off The Floor Bar: an intimate speakeasy experience for two, exploring the idea of bartender as storykeeper. An effort to bring stories back to The Floor over 40 years.
Goodnight Kiss: a final moment to kiss the floor goodnight.
